# vote-api 
Application web for vote 

## GITHUB: https://github.com/joaopaulopereira/vote-api

Rest api for creating and customizing polls and questionnaires, with a configurable time that allows "Sim" and "NÃ£o" and CPF value as answers and generates the result

An additional external CPF validation was requested at the time of adding a vote.

### Project architecture:
* Spring boot for Java 11 API
* Postgresql as database
* Heroku 
* Swagger - API documentation
* JMeter - Performance test
* Junit - Unit tests

The challenge is to develop an application that supports the volume of hundreds of thousands of simultaneous requests and remains stable. The solution discussed involves the asynchronous processing of polls and their votes, so that the number of server threads DOES NOT SCALE with the increase in requests. This is the great differential of the solution.

For api versioning, it is suggested to use the Swagger library, adopting the strategy with the least impact on clients: URI path.


### Setup
* Java JDK 11 
* Postgres database(set username, password, url and database name in resources/application.properties)
* Execute maven build and run java application into target folder with 'java -jar'  

### Results performance tests
As shown in the images below, the application remained completely stable even with the volume of hundreds of thousands of simultaneous requests, despite the localhost being a notebook with 8gb of ram and an i5 processor sharing all the application processes, database, monitoring tool , and OS applications
